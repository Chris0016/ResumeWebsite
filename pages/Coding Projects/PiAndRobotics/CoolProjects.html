			<p>I have yet to start working on any project on the Pi, as I am trying to familiarize myself with the OS. However I do have some ideas in mind.
			 I love nature and wildlife, and have always wondered of ways to incorporate it with technology. The Pi is a great resource for this application because of 
			how easy it to incorporated into projects. such as a small army of pi robots who's purpose will be to scout and collect data on a preserved park and its 
			wild life such as dear. This is a project of relatively large scale  for me, but I can see its uses and practicality in real life.
