	<p>
	In order to give the robot more awareness more IR sensors can be incorporated.
	Ultimately, this provides more degrees of movement and sensity as the robot goes from
	about 90 degrees to 180 degrees of perception. 
	
	Due to the small size of the bread board, one must consider the implications before making 
	the change. For instance, if most of the available space of the breadboard is used
	for the IR sensors then there is little to non space for other things such as the speaker 
	LED lights, or any other diffrent types of sensors.
