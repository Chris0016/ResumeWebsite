;  PROBLEM 1:
;  
;  Consider a social network similar to Twitter called Chirper. Each user has a name, a note about
;  whether or not they are a verified user, and follows some number of people. 
;  
;  Design a data definition for Chirper, including a template that is tail recursive and avoids 
;  cycles. 
;  
;  Then design a function called most-followers which determines which user in a Chirper Network is 
;  followed by the most people.
;  



(define-struct chirper (name verified? following) )
;;(make-chirper (String Boolean ListOfChirpers ))
;; interp. name: String representing the user's name
;;         verfied?: Boolean telling whether the chirper is verfied or not
;;         following: ListOfChirpers, stating the chirpers that are followed

(define person1 (make-chirper "Young Gravy" true empty ))
(define person2 (make-chirper "TM Sauce" true empty ))

(define person7 (make-chirper "Tego" true (list person1 person2 ) ))
(define person8 (make-chirper "Uq" false (list person6)  ))

(define person3 (make-chirper "Joe" false (list person4) ))
(define person4 (make-chirper "Jane" false (list person3) ))

(define person5 (make-chirper "Halo" false (list person4 person1 person2 ) ))
(define person6 (make-chirper "FR" false (list person7 ) ))





;  PROBLEM 2:
;  
;  In UBC's version of How to Code, there are often more than 800 students taking 
;  the course in any given semester, meaning there are often over 40 Teaching Assistants. 
;  
;  Designing a schedule for them by hand is hard work - luckily we've learned enough now to write 
;  a program to do it for us! 
;  
;  Below are some data definitions for a simplified version of a TA schedule. There are some 
;  number of slots that must be filled, each represented by a natural number. Each TA is 
;  available for some of these slots, and has a maximum number of shifts they can work. 
;  
;  Design a search program that consumes a list of TAs and a list of Slots, and produces one
;  valid schedule where each Slot is assigned to a TA, and no TA is working more than their 
;  maximum shifts. If no such schedules exist, produce false. 
; 
;  You should supplement the given check-expects and remember to follow the recipe!
